ruby_rogue
==========

The purpose of this repo is to recreate a roguelike tutorial in Ruby. See original tutorial: https://solarianprogrammer.com/2012/07/12/roguelike-game-cpp-11-part-0/

I am curretly testing different features in stand alone scripts, and will then combine them back into main.

main.rb - This will eventually be the main program. It will link all other files to itself.
curses_test.rb - This was the first test script. Its purpose was to test initializing a window and performa a couple of exercises.
win.rb - This was to test working with subwindows.
move.rb - This was to test initializing the player and moving it on screen.
terrain.rb - This was to explore different terrain generation methods.
